I strongly encourage forking!

```

# Development Setup

By the end of this, you will have the following tools installed. These are tools I use frequently, and may not be the right set of tools for everyone.

* homebrew
* git
* zsh
* ohmyzsh
* zsh-autocomplete
* packer
* terraform
* Hyper
* VSCode
* node
* npm
* meta
* Docker for Mac

# Chicken or the egg
Unfortunately, we have to install SOME things manually :(

## init-mac.sh

To get started, we will need `git`, and to get `git`, we will want to have homebrew installed. Fear not, head on over to `init-mac.sh`, click `Raw`, save the file onto your computer, and run it.

```
sh ~/Downloads/init-mac.sh
```

Next, clone this repository.
